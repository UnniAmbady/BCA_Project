            We would like to express our deepest gratitude to Nick Tan from GovTech, who was the guiding force and guru behind the successful completion of our LLM Project. 
            Without his committed guidance and unwavering support, this journey would not have been possible.
            
            Nick Tan not only taught us the intricacies of data embedding but also inspired us to immerse ourselves fully in this field. 
            His expertise, patience, and encouragement kept us motivated and on the right path throughout this project. 
            His passion for knowledge and his dedication to sharing it have left an indelible mark on our learning experience.
            
            Thank you, Nick Tan, for your invaluable contributions and for being such an exceptional mentor. 
            This success is a testament to your dedication, and we are truly grateful to have had the privilege of learning under your guidance.
